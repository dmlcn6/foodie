// The doPost method makes the POST and then gets a response that is a Data object.
// The Data object is likely going to be JSON sent as a response from the server
// that needs to be parsed (this example does not parse it).

// In getExplorePageData:
// toURLString - is the URL to which the POST is to be made.  It can contain GET variables.
// dataString - is an & separated set of key/value pairs that are the POST data.
// completionHandler - is the closure to be called after the POST is made and the response is 
//                     received.
//                   - the parameters on the completionHandler are a Data optional and a String 
//                     optional that contains an error message
//                     if not nil.  If String optional is not nil an error occurred.

// To do a POST the httpMethod on the URLRequest object must be set to "POST".
// The the httpBody on the URLRequest object is set to the data which in this case
// is based on key/value pairs in a String.  The dataString is converted to a UTF8 encoded
// Data object before it is set as the httpBody on the URLRequest object.

// When a response is received or an error occurs the completionHandler is invoked.
// Because the request happens on a thread different than the main/UI thread
// DispatchQueue.main.sync is used to invoke the completionHandler on the main thread.
// The UI (say, a method or closure in a View Controller) should never be called directly
// from another thread than the main thread.
